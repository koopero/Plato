# Project Plato

The goal is the creation of a full set of all 5 regular polyhedra, or Platonic Solids, using programmable LEDs and 3D printed plastic.

- Open-source hardware & software.
- AI-assisted programming and design practices.
- Iteratative & improvisational design processes.
- Parametric practical geometry. 
- PCB design using Kicad
